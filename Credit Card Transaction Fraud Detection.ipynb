Determine the Level of Importance for each Candidate Variable with a Score\n","#### Tree-Based and Averaging .feature_importances_ Scores\n","We decided to use three tree-based algorithms to determine the level of importance of the candidate variables (scores). We used a decision tree, a random forest, and a boosted tree. For each tree-based algorithm, we extracted the \".feature_importance_\" method from the resultant model as the scores and then ranked those scores from 1 to n. We then averaged the three ranks and used the average to give a final rank ordering of the candidate variables from 1 to n.
